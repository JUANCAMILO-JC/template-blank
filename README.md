=========================================================

This Intel XDK project has just an `index.html` file with the basic html, head
and body tags required for building HTML5 mobile apps. Use this template to
create a packaged apps that do not use any device features.

The `icon.png` and `screenshot.png` files are not required by your project. They
are included for use by the Intel XDK template/demo panel and have no use within
a real app. You can safely delete them from your project directory.

This blank template does not require any Cordova APIs. If you would like to add
Cordova APIs to your application (via Cordova plugins) you must first convert
your project into a Cordova project. You can do this by clicking the Cordova
icon in the *Project Info* section on the **Projects** tab. Or, you can create a
new Cordova project using a Cordova blank template or a Cordova demo or sample
app as a starting point.
